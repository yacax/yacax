      This repository is an enhanced version of my original diploma project's
      frontend. Building on the core functionality of a service where users can
      search for films and save their favorites, this new iteration introduces
      PWA (Progressive Web App) capabilities and a language switcher feature.

    <p>
      The objective of this project is to build a service that allows users to
      search for films and save their favourite ones in a personal space. The
      user enters keywords into the search bar and clicks on the "Search"
      button. Then, two actions are performed: A request is sent to our movie
      data service to retrieve and save data. Films corresponding to the
      selected genre are found and displayed as cards. When a user saves a film,
      it appears in a special section of the website.
