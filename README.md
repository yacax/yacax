    <h3>Improved Graduation Project</h3>
     <p>This repository is an enhanced version of my original diploma project's frontend. Building on the core functionality of a service where users can search for films and save their favorites, this new iteration introduces PWA (Progressive Web App) capabilities and a language switcher feature.</p>

    <h3>Graduation Project</h3>
    <p>The objective of this project is to build a service that allows users to search for films and save their favourite ones in a personal space. The user enters keywords into the search bar and clicks on the "Search" button. Then, two actions are performed:

A request is sent to our movie data service to retrieve and save data. Films
corresponding to the selected genre are found and displayed as cards. When a
user saves a film, it appears in a special section of the website.</p>
